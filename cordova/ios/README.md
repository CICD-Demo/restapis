Import the Ticket-monster Code
--------------------------

First we need to import the existing iOS code to XCode.

1. Open Finder and navigate to `$TICKET-MONSTER_HOME/cordova/ios/`
2. Right click on *TicketMonster.xcodeproj* and select *Open With XCode*
3. Change the Target in the Scheme menu to TicketMonster and select a device
4. Make sure that your `$TICKET-MONSTER_HOME/cordova/ios/www` is a symbolic link to `../../demo/src/main/webapp/`


Run and Access the application
------------------------------

If the toolbar in XCode is visible, click on the *Run* button. This will start the iOS Simulator with this project running in it. If your toolbar is not visible, click `View -> Show Toolbar` to show it.
