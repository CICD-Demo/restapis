:Author: Burr Sutter

== Purpose and Target Audience

The target audience for this tutorial are those individuals who do not yet have a great deal of experience with:

* Eclipse + JBoss Tools (JBoss Developer Studio)
* JBoss Enterprise Application 6 or JBoss AS 7
* Java EE 6 features like JAX-RS 
* HTML5 & jQuery for building an mobile web front-end.  

This tutorial sets the stage for the creation of TicketMonster - our sample application that illustrates how to bring together the best features of *Java EE 6 + HTML5 + JBoss* to create a rich, mobile-optimized and dynamic application.

TicketMonster is developed as an open source application, and you can find it link:https://github.com/jboss-jdf/ticket-monster[at github]. 

If you prefer to watch instead of read, a large portion of this content is also covered in link:http://docs.jboss.org/tools/movies/[video form]. 

In this tutorial, we will cover the following topics:

- Working with JBoss Developer Studio (Eclipse + JBoss Tools)
- Creating of a Java EE 6 project via a Maven archetype
- Leveraging m2e and m2e-wtp
- Using Forge to create a JPA entity
- Using Hibernate Tools
- Database Schema Generation
- Deployment to a local JBoss Server
- Adding a JAX-RS endpoint
- Adding a jQuery Mobile client
- Using the Mobile BrowserSim

== Installation


The first order of business is to get your development environment setup and JBoss Developer Studio v7 installed. JBoss Developer Studio is Eclipse Kepler (e4.3) for Java EE Developers plus select JBoss Tools and is available for free. Visit https://devstudio.jboss.com/download/7.x.html to download it.  You may also choose to install JBoss Tools 4.1 into your existing Eclipse for Java EE Developers installation. This document uses screenshots depicting JBoss Developer Studio.

You must have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed, either v6 or v7 will work - whilst a JVM runtime will work for most use cases, for a developer environment it is normally best to have the full JDK. System requirements for JBoss Developer Studio are listed in the System Requirements chapter of the link:https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_Developer_Studio/7.0/html/Installation_Guide/chap-System_Requirements.html[JBoss Developer Studio 7.0 Installation Guide] online documentation.

[TIP]
==============================================================
If you prefer to see JBoss Developer studio being installed,
then check out link:http://vimeo.com/39606090[this video].

To see JBoss Tools being installed into Eclipse, see
link:http://vimeo.com/39743315[this video].
==============================================================

The JBoss Developer Studio installer has a (very long!) name such as `jbdevstudio-product-universal-7.0.0.GA-v20130720-0044-B364.jar`
where the latter portion of the file name relates to build date and version information and the text near the front related to the target operating system. The "universal" installer is for any operating system.  To launch the installer you may simply be able to double-click on the .jar file name or you may need to issue the following from the operating system command line:

    java -jar jbdevstudio-product-universal-7.0.0.GA-v20130720-0044-B364.jar

We recommend using the "universal" installer as it handles Windows, Mac OS X and Linux - 32-bit and 64-bit versions.

[NOTE]
===============================================================
Even if you are installing on a 64-bit OS, you may still wish 
to use the 32-bit JVM for the JBoss Developer Studio (or 
Eclipse + JBoss Tools). Only the 32-bit version provides a
supported version of the Visual Page Editor - a split-pane 
editor that gives you a glimpse of what your HTML/XHTML (JSF,
 JSP, etc) will look like.
Also, the 32-bit version uses less memory than the 64-bit 
version. You may still run your application server in 64-bit 
JVMs if needed to insure compatibility with the production
environment whilst keeping your IDE in 32-bit mode.
Visual Page Editor has experimental support for 64-bit JVMs in JBoss 
Developer Studio 7. Please refer https://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBosstoolsVisualEditorFAQ[the JBoss Tools Visual Editor FAQ] for details.
===============================================================

[[installer-wizard_image]]
.Installation Wizard, Step 1 of 9
image::gfx/introduction/installer_wizard_page1.png[]

The rest of the steps are fairly self explanatory.  If you run into trouble, please consult the videos above as they explore a few troubleshooting tips related to JRE/JDK setup.

Please make sure to say *Yes* to the prompt that says "Will you allow JBoss Tools team to receive anonymous usage statistics for this Eclipse instance with JBoss Tools?".  This information is very helpful to us when it comes to prioritizing our QA efforts in terms of operating system platforms. More information concerning our usage tracking can be found at http://www.jboss.org/tools/usage

You can skip the step in the installation wizard that allows you to install JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7 as we will do this in the next step.

== Creating a new Java EE 6 project with Maven


[TIP]
=================================================================
For a deeper dive into the world of Maven and how it is used with
JBoss Developer Studio and JBoss Enterprise Application 
Platform 6 (or JBoss Tools and JBoss AS 7) review http://vimeo.com/39796236[this video].
=================================================================

Now that everything is properly installed, configured, running and verified to work, let's build something "from scratch".

We recommend that you switch to the JBoss Perspective if you have not already.  

[TIP]
=================================================================
If you close JBoss Central, it is only a click away - simply 
click on the JBoss icon in the Eclipse toolbar - it is normally 
the last icon, on the last row - assuming you are in the JBoss 
Perspective.
=================================================================

First, select *Start from scratch -> Java EE Web Project* in JBoss Central. Under the covers, this uses a Maven archetype which creates a Java EE 6 web application (.war), based around Maven.  The project can be built outside of the IDE, and in continuous integration solutions like Hudson/Jenkins.

[[jboss-central_image]]
.JBoss Central
image::gfx/introduction/jboss_dev_studio_jboss_central.png[]

You will be prompted with a dialog box that verifies that JBoss Developer Studio is configured correctly. If you are in a brand new workspace, the application server will not be configured yet and you will notice the lack of a check mark on the server/runtime row.

[[new-project-wizard_image]]
.New Project Wizard
image::gfx/introduction/new_project_wizard.png[]

[NOTE]
=================================================================
There are several ways to add JBoss Enterprise Application 
Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7 to JBoss Developer Studio. The 
*Install...* button on the new project wizard is probably the
easiest, but you can use any of the methods you are familiar 
with!
=================================================================

To add JBoss Enterprise Application Platform or JBoss AS 7, click on the *Install...* button, or if you have not yet downloaded and unzipped the server, click on the *Download and Install...* button.  

[CAUTION]
=================================================================
The download option only works with the community application 
server. Although the enterprise application server is listed, it
still needs to be manually downloaded.
=================================================================

Selecting *Install...* will pop up the JBoss Runtime Detection section of Preferences.  You can always get back to this dialog by selecting *Preferences -> JBoss Tools -> JBoss Tools Runtime Detection*.

[[jboss_tools_runtime_detection_image]]
.JBoss Tools Runtime Detection
image::gfx/introduction/jboss_tools_runtime_detection.png[]

Select the *Add* button which will take you to a file browser dialog where you should locate your unzipped JBoss server.

[[runtime_open_dialog_image]]
.Runtime Open Dialog
image::gfx/introduction/runtime_open_dialog.png[]

Select *Open* and JBoss Developer Studio will pop up the *Searching for runtimes...* window. 

[[searching_for_runtimes_dialog_image]]
.Searching for runtimes window
image::gfx/introduction/searching_for_runtimes_dialog.png[]

Simply select *OK*. You should see the added runtime in the Paths list.

[[jboss_tools_runtime_detection_after_image]]
.JBoss Tools Runtime Detection Completed
image::gfx/introduction/jboss_tools_runtime_detection_after.png[]

Select *OK* to close the *Preferences* dialog, and you will be returned to the *New Project Example* dialog, with the the server/runtime found.

[[as_eap_found_image]]
.JBoss AS 7.0/7.1 or EAP 6 Found
image::gfx/introduction/as_eap_found.png[]

The *Target Runtime* allows you to choose between JBoss Enterprise Application Platform and JBoss AS 7. If it is left empty, JBoss AS 7 will be elected.

[CAUTION]
===================================================================================
Choosing an enterprise application server as the runtime will require you to 
configure Maven to use the JBoss Enterprise Maven repositories. For instructions on 
configure the Maven repositories, visit the link:https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/6.1/html-single/Development_Guide/index.html#Install_the_JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform_6_Maven_Repository[JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1 documentation].
===================================================================================

Select *Next*.

[[new-project-wizard-step_2_image]]
.New Project Wizard Step 2
image::gfx/introduction/new_project_example_step_2.png[]

The default *Project name* is `jboss-javaee6-webapp`. If this field appears blank, it is because your workspace already contains a "jboss-javaee6-webapp" in which case just provide another name for your project. Change the project name to `ticket-monster`, and the package name to `org.jboss.jdf.example.ticketmonster`.

Select *Finish*.

JBoss Tools/JBoss Developer Studio will now generate the template project and import it into the workspace.  You will see it pop up into the Project Explorer and a message that asks if you would like to review the readme file.

[[prompt_for_readme_image]]
.New Project Wizard Step 3
image::gfx/introduction/prompt_for_readme.png[]

Select *Finish*

== Exploring the newly generated project

Using the *Project Explorer*, open up the generated project, and double-click on the `pom.xml`.

The generated project is a Maven-based project with a `pom.xml` in its root directory.

[[newly_generated_project_explorer_image]]
.Project Explorer
image::gfx/introduction/newly_generated_project_explorer.png[]

JBoss Developer Studio and JBoss Tools include m2e and m2e-wtp. m2e is the Maven Eclipse plug-in and provides a graphical editor for editing `pom.xml` files, along with the ability to run maven goals directly from within Eclipse.  m2e-wtp allows you to deploy your Maven-based project directly to any Web Tools Project (WTP) compliant application server.  This means you can drag & drop, use *Run As -> Run on Server* and other mechanisms to have the IDE deploy your application.

The `pom.xml` editor has several tabs along its bottom edge.

[[pom_xml_tabs_image]]
.pom.xml Editor Tabs
image::gfx/introduction/pom_xml_tabs.png[]

For this tutorial, we do not need to edit the `pom.xml` as it already provides the Java EE 6 APIs that we will need (e.g. JPA, JAX-RS, CDI). You should spend some time exploring the *Dependencies* and the *pom.xml* (source view) tabs.   

One key element to make note of is `<version.jboss.bom>1.0.4.Final</version.jboss.bom>` which establishes if this project uses JBoss Enterprise Application Platform or JBoss AS dependencies. The BOM (Bill of Materials) specifies the versions of the Java EE (and other) APIs defined in the dependency section.

If you are using JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 and you selected that as your Target Runtime, you will find a `-redhat-1` suffix on the version string. You may need to setup the JBoss Enterprise Maven repository to use the certified dependencies in your project, details of which are available link:https://community.jboss.org/wiki/SettingUpTheJBossEnterpriseRepositories[here].

[CAUTION]
========================================================================================
The specific version of the BOM (e.g. `1.0.4.Final`) is likely to change, so do not 
be surprised if the version is slightly different.

The recommended version of the BOM for a runtime (EAP 6 or AS 7) can be 
obtained by visiting link:http://www.jboss.org/jdf/stack/stacks/[the JBoss Stacks site].
========================================================================================

[[project_explorer_java_packages_image]]
.Project Explorer Java Packages
image::gfx/introduction/project_explorer_java_packages.png[]

Using the *Project Explorer*, drill-down into `src/main/java` under *Java Resources*.

The initial project includes the following Java packages:

`.controller`::
    contains the backing beans for `#{newMember}` and `#{memberRegistration}` in the JSF page `index.xhtml`
`.data`::
    contains a class which uses `@Produces` and `@Named` to return the list of members for `index.xhtml`
`.model`::
    contains the JPA entity class, a POJO annotated with `@Entity`, annotated with Bean Validation (JSR 303) constraints
`.rest`::
    contains the JAX-RS endpoints, POJOs annotated with `@Path`
`.service`::
    handles the registration transaction for new members
`.util`::
    contains Resources.java which sets up an alias for `@PersistenceContext` to be injectable via `@Inject`

Now, let's explore the resources in the project.

[[project_explorer_resources_image]]
.Project Explorer Resources
image::gfx/introduction/project_explorer_resources.png[]

Under src you will find:

`main/resources/import.sql`::
    contains insert statements that provides initial database data.  This is particularly useful when `hibernate.hbm2dll.auto=create-drop` is set in `persistence.xml`.  `hibernate.hbm2dll.auto=create-drop` causes the schema to be recreated each time the application is deployed.
`main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml`::
    establishes that this project contains JPA entities and it identifies the datasource, which is deployed alongside the project. It also includes the `hibernate.hbm2dll.auto` property set to `create-drop` by default. 

`test/java/test`::
    provides the `.test` package that contains `MemberRegistrationTest.java`, an Arquillian based test that runs both from within JBoss Developer Studio via *Run As -> JUnit Test* and at the command line:
    +
    +
    `mvn test –Parq-jbossas-remote`
    +
    +
    Note that you will need to start the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7 server before running the test.
   
`src/main/webapp`::
    contains `index.xhtml`, the JSF-based user interface for the sample application.  If you double-click on that file you will see Visual Page Editor allows you to visually navigate through the file and see the source simultaneously. Changes to the source are immediately reflected in the visual pane.

[[visual_page_editor_image]]
.Visual Page Editor
image::gfx/introduction/visual_page_editor.png[]

In `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF`, you will find three key files:

`beans.xml`::
   is an empty file that indicates this is a CDI capable EE6 application
`faces-config.xml`::
   is an empty file that indicates this is a JSF capable EE6 application
`ticket-monster-ds.xml`::
   when deployed, creates a new datasource within the JBoss container


== Adding a new entity using Forge


There are several ways to add a new JPA entity to your project:

Starting from scratch::
    Right-click on the `.model` package and select *New -> Class*.  JPA entities are annotated POJOs so starting from a simple class is a common approach.
Reverse Engineering::
    Right-click on the "model" package and select New -> JPA Entities from Tables.  For more information on this technique see link:https://vimeo.com/39608294[this video]
Using Forge::
    to create a new entity for your project using a CLI (we will explore this in more detail below)
Reverse Engineering with Forge::
    Forge has a Hibernate Tools plug-in that allows you to script the conversion of RDBMS schema into JPA entities.  For more information on this technique see link:https://vimeo.com/39608326[this video].

For the purposes of this tutorial, we will take advantage of Forge to add a new JPA entity. This requires the least keystrokes, and we do not yet have a RDBMS schema to reverse engineer.  There is also an optional section for adding an entity using *New -> Class*.

Right-click on the `.model` package in the *Project Explorer* and select *Show In -> Forge Console*.

[[show_in_forge_console_image]]
.Show In Forge Console 
image::gfx/introduction/show_in_forge_console.png[]

[TIP]
==============================================================================
Alternative methods to activate Forge include:

* *Window -> Show View -> Forge Console*
* *Ctrl 4* (Windows) or *Cmd 4* (Mac).

Note: the Show In method will issue a "pick-up" command to switch you to the 
right location within your project.
==============================================================================

The first time you start Forge, you will be prompted with a *Forge Not Running* dialog, select *Yes*.

[[forge_is_not_running_image]]
.Show Forge Not Running
image::gfx/introduction/forge_is_not_running.png[]

[TIP]
==============================================================================
If you are not prompted you can always start Forge using the green arrow (or 
stop via the red square) in the Forge Console tab.

[[forge_start_stop_image]]
.Show Forge Start/Stop
image::gfx/introduction/forge_console_tab.png[]
==============================================================================

[[forge_console_image]]
.Show Forge Console
image::gfx/introduction/forge_console.png[]

Forge is a command-oriented rapid application development tool that allows you to enter commands that generate classes and code. It will automatically update the IDE for you.  A key feature is "content assist" or "tab completion", activated by pressing *tab*.

To generate an entity, use these commands:

[source,fsh]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
entity --named Event --package org.jboss.jdf.example.ticketmonster.model
field string --named name
validation setup --provider JAVA_EE
constraint NotNull --onProperty name
constraint Size --onProperty name --min 5 --max 50 --message "Must be > 5 and < 50"
field string --named description
constraint Size --onProperty description --min 20 --max 1000 --message "Must be > 20 and < 1000"
field boolean --named major
field string --named picture
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's work through this, step by step.

At the `[ticket-monster] model $` prompt, type `en` and hit the tab key on your keyboard.  `entity` will fill in.   Hit tab again and `entity --named` will appear.  Type in `Event` and add a space -- Forge can not anticipate the name of your new entity!

Hit tab again and select `--package`.  Now, hit tab repeatedly to fill in `org.jboss.jdf.example.ticketmonster`. Since there are multiple entries underneath examples, Forge will display those options.  Type in `m` and hit tab to select `model`.

Now hit the Enter/Return key to watch the command execute.  The Event entity will be generated into the "model" package and open up inside of Eclipse.

[[forge_event_entity_image]]
.Forge new entity
image::gfx/introduction/forge_event_entity.png[]

[[forge_event_entity_created_image]]
.Event Entity
image::gfx/introduction/forge_event_entity_created.png[]

[NOTE]
==============================================================================
`@Entity public class` is placed on the same line as `
import java.lang.Override` by Forge. Using the formatter your IDE provides on
the entity will make this look more like you would expect!
==============================================================================

Forge has automatically changed the context of the CLI to `Event.java`, and typing `ls` will provide a listing of the fields and methods.  
[[forge_ls_results_image]]
.Forge `ls`
image::gfx/introduction/forge_ls.png[]

Now that the base `Event` entity has been created, let's add the fields and their JSR 303 Bean Validation constraints.  

This next step involves adding a `name` property for the Event entity so that an event could hold data like "Rock Concert". 

Type `fie` and hit tab to fill in `field`, if you hit *tab* again, Forge will list out the possible field types.   Type in `s` and hit *tab*, Forge will respond with `string`.  Hit *tab* again to get `--named` and type in `name`.   
You should end up with the command `field string --named name`, to execute it, press enter.  This will add a `private String name;` field, and the appropriate accessor and mutator (getter and setter) methods.  You should also notice that the toString method is tweaked to include `name` as well.

[[forge_added_name_image]]
.@Column name
image::gfx/introduction/forge_added_name.png[]

From this point forward, we will assume you have the basics of using Forge's interactive command line. The remaining commands to run are:

[source,fsh]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
validation setup --provider JAVA_EE
constraint NotNull --onProperty name
constraint Size --onProperty name --min 5 --max 50 --message "Must be > 5 and < 50"
field string --named description
constraint Size --onProperty description --min 20 --max 1000 --message "Must be > 20 and < 1000"
field boolean --named major
field string --named picture
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


The easiest way to see the results of Forge operating on the `Event.java` JPA Entity is to use the *Outline View* of JBoss Developer Studio. It is normally on the right-side of the IDE when using the JBoss Perspective.

[[outline_of_event_image]]
.Outline View
image::gfx/introduction/outline_of_event.png[]


== Reviewing persistence.xml & updating import.sql


By default, the entity classes generate the database schema, and is controlled by `src/main/resources/persistence.xml`.

The two key settings are the `<jta-data-source>` and the `hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto` property.  The datasource maps to the datasource defined in `src\main\webapp\ticket-monster–ds.xml`.

The `hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=create-drop` property indicates that all database tables will be dropped when an application is undeployed, or redeployed, and created when the application is deployed.

The `import.sql` file contains SQL statements that will inject sample data into your initial database structure.  Add the following insert statements:

[source,sql]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
insert into Event (id, name, description, major, picture, version) values (1, 'Shane''s Sock Puppets', 'This critically acclaimed masterpiece...', true, 'http://dl.dropbox.com/u/65660684/640px-Carnival_Puppets.jpg', 1);
insert into Event (id, name, description, major, picture, version) values (2, 'Rock concert of the decade', 'Get ready to rock...', true, 'http://dl.dropbox.com/u/65660684/640px-Weir%2C_Bob_(2007)_2.jpg', 1);
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Adding a new entity using JBoss Developer Studio


Alternatively, we can add an entity with JBoss Developer Studio or JBoss Tools.

First, right-click on the `.model` package and select *New -> Class*.  Enter the class name as `Venue` - our concerts & shows happen at particular stadiums, concert halls and theaters. 

First, add some private fields representing the entities properties, which translate to the columns in the database table.

[source,java]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
package org.jboss.jdf.example.ticketmonster.model;

public class Venue {
	private Long id;
	private String name;
	private String description;
	private int capacity;
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, right-click on the editor itself, and from the pop-up, context menu select *Source -> Generate Getters and Setters*.

[[generate_getters_setters_menu_image]]
.Generate Getters and Setters Menu
image::gfx/introduction/generate_getters_setters.png[]

This will create accessor and mutator methods for all your fields, making them accessible properties for the entity class.

[[generate_getters_setters_dialog_image]]
.Generate Getters and Setters Dialog
image::gfx/introduction/getter_setter_dialog.png[]

Click *Select All* and then *OK*.

[[venue_after_getters_setters_image]]
.Venue.java with gets/sets
image::gfx/introduction/venue_after_getters_setters.png[]

Now, right-click on the editor, from the pop-up context menu select *Source -> Generate Hibernate/JPA Annotations*.

If you are prompted to save `Venue.java`, simply select OK.

[[save_modified_resources_image]]
.Save Modified Resources
image::gfx/introduction/save_modified_resources.png[]

The *Hibernate: add JPA annotations* wizard will start up. First, verify that `Venue` is the class you are working on.

[[hibernate_add_jpa_image]]
.Hibernate: add JPA annotations
image::gfx/introduction/hibernate_add_jpa_annotations.png[]

Select *Next*.

The next step in the wizard will provide a sampling of the refactored sources – describing the basic changes that are being made to `Venue`.

[[hibernate_add_jpa_annotations_step2_image]]
.Hibernate: add JPA annotations Step 2
image::gfx/introduction/hibernate_add_jpa_annotations_step2.png[]

Select *Finish*.

Now you may wish to add the Bean Validation constraint annotations, such as `@NotNull` to the fields.

== Deployment


At this point, if you have not already deployed the application, right click on the project name in the Project Explorer and select *Run As -> Run on Server*.  If needed, this will startup the application server instance, compile & build the application and push the application into the `JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments` directory.  This directory is scanned for new deployments, so simply placing your war in the directory will cause it to be deployed.

[CAUTION]
=================================================================
If you have been using another application server or web server 
such as Tomcat, shut it down now to avoid any port conflicts.
=================================================================

[[run_as_run_on_server_image]]
.Run As -> Run on Server
image::gfx/introduction/run_as_run_on_server.png[]

Now, deploy the h2console webapp. You can read how to do this in the link:http://www.jboss.org/jdf/quickstarts/jboss-as-quickstart/h2-console/[h2console quickstart].

The *Run As -> Run on Server* option will also launch the internal Eclipse browser with the appropriate URL so that you can immediately begin interacting with the application.

[[result_run_on_server_image]]
.Eclipse Browser after Run As -> Run on Server
image::gfx/introduction/result_run_on_server.png[]

Now, go to http://localhost:8080/h2console to start up the h2 console.

[[h2console_in_browser_image]]
.h2console in browser
image::gfx/introduction/h2console_in_browser.png[]

Use `jdbc:h2:mem:ticket-monster` as the JDBC URL (this is defined in `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/ticket-monster-ds.xml`), `sa` as the username and `sa` as the password.

Click *Connect*

You will see both the `EVENT` table, the `VENUE` table and the `MEMBER` tables have been added to the H2 schema.

And if you enter the SQL statement: `select * from event` and select the *Run* (Ctrl-Enter) button, it will display the data you entered in the `import.sql` file in a previous step.  With these relatively simple steps, you have verified that your new EE 6 JPA entities have been added to the system and deployed successfully, creating the supporting RDBMS schema as needed.

[[h2console_select_from_event.png]]
.h2console Select * from Event
image::gfx/introduction/h2console_select_from_event.png[]


== Adding a JAX-RS RESTful web service


The goal of this section of the tutorial is to walk you through the creation of a POJO with the JAX-RS annotations. 

Right-click on the `.rest` package, select *New -> Class* from the context menu, and enter `EventService` as the class name.

[[new_class_eventservice_image]]
.New Class EventService
image::gfx/introduction/new_class_eventservice.png[]

Select *Finish*.

Replace the contents of the class with this sample code: 

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
package org.jboss.jdf.example.ticketmonster.rest;

@Path("/events")
@RequestScoped
public class EventService {
	@Inject
	private EntityManager em;
	
	@GET
	@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
	public List<Event> getAllEvents() {
		final List<Event> results = 
			em.createQuery(
			"select e from Event e order by e.name").getResultList();
		return results;
	}
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This class is a JAX-RS endpoint that returns all Events.

[[event_service_copy_paste_image]]
.EventService after Copy and Paste
image::gfx/introduction/event_service_copy_paste.png[]

You'll notice a lot of errors, relating to missing imports. The easiest way to solve this is to right-click inside the editor and select *Source -> Organize Imports* from the context menu. 

[[source_organize_imports_image]]
.Source -> Organize -> Imports
image::gfx/introduction/source_organize_imports.png[]

Some of the class names are not unique. Eclipse will prompt you with any decisions around what class is intended. Select the following:

* `javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType`
* `org.jboss.jdf.example.ticketmonster.model.Event`
* `javax.ws.rs.Produces`
* `java.util.List`
* `java.inject.Inject`
* `java.enterprise.context.RequestScoped`

The following screenshots illustrate how you handle these decisions. The Figure description indicates the name of the class you should select.

image::gfx/introduction/organize_imports_5.png[]

[[organize_imports_6_image]]
.javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped
image::gfx/introduction/organize_imports_6.png[]

You should end up with these imports:

[source,java]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import java.util.List;

import javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.persistence.EntityManager;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

import org.jboss.jdf.example.ticketmonster.model.Event;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once these import statements are in place you should have no more compilation errors. When you save `EventService.java`, you will see it listed in JAX-RS REST Web Services in the Project Explorer.

[[project_explorer_jax_rs_services_image]]
.Project Explorer JAX-RS Services
image::gfx/introduction/project_explorer_jax_rs_services.png[]

This feature of JBoss Developer Studio and JBoss Tools provides a nice visual indicator that you have successfully configured your JAX-RS endpoint. 

You should now redeploy your project via *Run As -> Run on Server*, or by right clicking on the project in the *Servers* tab and select *Full Publish*.

[[full_publish_image]]
.Full Publish

[NOTE]
=================================================================================
The `rest` prefix is setup in a file called `JaxRsActivator.java` which contains 
a small bit of code that sets up the application for JAX-RS endpoints.

== Adding a jQuery Mobile client application


Now, it is time to add a HTML5, jQuery based client application that is optimized for the mobile web experience.

There are numerous JavaScript libraries that help you optimize the end-user experience on a mobile web browser. We have found that jQuery Mobile is one of the easier ones to get started with but as your skills mature, you might investigate solutions like Sencha Touch, Zepto or Jo.  This tutorial focuses on jQuery Mobile as the basis for creating the UI layer of the application.

The UI components interact with the JAX-RS RESTful services (e.g. `EventService.java`). 

[TIP]
=================================================================================

out link:http://www.jboss.org/aerogear[Aerogear].
=================================================================================

These next steps will guide you through the creation of a file called `mobile.html` that provides a mobile friendly version of the application, using jQuery Mobile.

First, using the Project Explorer, navigate to `src/main/webapp`, and right-click on `webapp`, and choose *New HTML file*.
[[new_html_file_image]]
.New HTML File
image::gfx/introduction/new_html_file.png[]

[CAUTION]
=================================================================================
In certain versions of JBoss Developer Studio, the New HTML File Wizard may start 
off with your target location being `m2e-wtp/web-resources`, this is an 
incorrect location and it is a bug, link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-11472[JBIDE-11472].

It has been corrected in JBoss Developer Studio 6.
=================================================================================

Change directory to `ticket-monster/src/main/webapp` and enter name the file `mobile.html`.

[[new_html_file_correct_location_image]]
.New HTML File src/main/webapp
image::gfx/introduction/new_html_file_correct_location.png[]

Select *Next*.

On the *Select HTML Template* page of the *New HTML File* wizard, select *New HTML File (5)*.  This template will get you started with a boilerplate HTML5 document.

[[select_html_template]]
.Select New HTML File (5) Template
image::gfx/introduction/select_html_template.png[]

Select *Finish*.

The document must start with `<!DOCTYPE html>` as this identifies the page as HTML 5 based. For this particular phase of the tutorial, we are not introducing a bunch of HTML 5 specific concepts like the new form fields (type=email), websockets or the new CSS capabilities.  For now, we simply wish to get our mobile application completed as soon as possible.  The good news is that jQuery and jQuery Mobile make the consumption of a RESTful endpoint very simple.

You will now notice the Palette View visible in the JBoss perspective. This view contains a collection of popular jQuery Mobile widgets that can be dragged and dropped into the HTML pages to speed up construction of jQuery Mobile pages.

[[jquery_mobile_palette]]
.The jQuery Mobile Palette
image::gfx/introduction/jquery_mobile_palette.png[]

[TIP]
=================================================================
For a deeper dive into the jQuery Mobile palette feature in 
JBoss Developer Studio review http://vimeo.com/67480300[this video].
=================================================================

Let us first set the title of the HTML5 document as:

[source,html]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>TicketMonster</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We shall now add the jQuery and jQuery Mobile JavaScript and CSS files to the HTML document. Luckily for us we can do this by clicking the _JS/CSS_ widget in the palette.

[[js_css_widget]]
.Click the JS/CSS widget
image::gfx/introduction/js_css_widget.png[]

This results in the following document with the jQuery JavaScript file and the jQuery Mobile JavaScript and CSS files being added to the _head_ element.  

[source,html]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.1/jquery.mobile-1.3.1.min.css" />
    <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.min.js"></script>
    <script src="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.1/jquery.mobile-1.3.1.min.js"></script>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>TicketMonster</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We shall now proceed to setup the page layout. Click the _page_ widget in the palette to do so. Ensure that the cursor is in the `<body>` element of the document when you do so.

[[jquery_mobile_page_widget]]
.Click the page widget
image::gfx/introduction/jquery_mobile_page_widget.png[]

[CAUTION]
=================================================================
When you click some of the widgets in the palette, it is important
to have the cursor in the right element of the document.
Failing to observe this will result in the widget being added in 
undesired locations. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the 
widget to the desired location in the document.
=================================================================

This opens a dialog to configure the jQuery Mobile page.

[[jquery_mobile_page]]
.Create a new jQuery Mobile page
image::gfx/introduction/jquery_mobile_page.png[]

Set the page title as "TicketMonster", footer as blank, and the ID as "page1". Click *Finish* to add a new jQuery Mobile page to the document. The layout is now established.

[source,html]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.1/jquery.mobile-1.3.1.min.css" />
    <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.min.js"></script>
    <script src="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.1/jquery.mobile-1.3.1.min.js"></script>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>TicketMonster</title>
</head>
<body>
	<div data-role="page" id="page1">
		<div data-role="header">
			<h1>TicketMonster</h1>
		</div>
		<div data-role="content">
			<p>Page content goes here.</p>
		</div>
		<div data-role="footer">
			<h4></h4>
		</div>
	</div>
</body>
</html>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To populate the page content, remove the paragraph element: `<p>Page content goes here.</p>` to start with a blank content section. Click the _Listview_ widget in the palette to start populating the content section.

[[jquery_mobile_listview_widget]]
.Click the Listview widget
image::gfx/introduction/jquery_mobile_listview_widget.png[]

This opens a new dialog to configure the jQuery Mobile listview widget.

[[jquery_mobile_listview]]
.Add a jQuery Mobile Listview widget
image::gfx/introduction/jquery_mobile_listview.png[]

Select the inset checkbox to display the list as an inset list. Inset lists do not span the entire widget of the display. Set the ID as "listOfItems". Retain the number of items in the list as three, and also their labels, but modify the URL values to '#'. Retain the default values for the other fields, and click *Finish*. This will create a listview widget with 3 item entries in the list. The jQuery Mobile page is now structurally complete.

[source,html]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.1/jquery.mobile-1.3.1.min.css" />
    <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.min.js"></script>
    <script src="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.1/jquery.mobile-1.3.1.min.js"></script>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<title>TicketMonster</title>
</head>
<body>
	<div data-role="page" id="page1">
		<div data-role="header">
			<h1>TicketMonster</h1>
		</div>
		<div data-role="content">
			<ul data-role="listview" id="listOfItems" data-inset="true">
				<li><a href="#">Item 1</a></li>
				<li><a href="#">Item 2</a></li>
				<li><a href="#">Item 3</a></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div data-role="footer">
			<h4></h4>
		</div>
	</div>
</body>
</html>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You might notice that in the *Visual Page Editor*, the visual portion is not that attractive, this is because the majority of jQuery Mobile magic happens at runtime and our visual page editor simply displays the HTML without embellishment.

Visit link:http://localhost:8080/ticket-monster/mobile.html[].

[NOTE]
=================================================================================
Note: Normally HTML files are deployed automatically, if you find it missing, 
just use Full Publish or Run As Run on Server as demonstrated in previous steps.
=================================================================================

As soon as the page loads, you can view the jQuery Mobile enhanced page.

[[jquery_mobile_template_image]]

One side benefit of using a HTML5 + jQuery-based front-end to your application is that it allows for fast turnaround in development.  Simply edit the HTML file, save the file and refresh your browser.  

Now the secret sauce to connecting your front-end to your back-end is simply observing the jQuery Mobile _pageinit_ JavaScript event and including an invocation of the previously created Events JAX-RS service.

Insert the following block of code as the last item in the `<head>` element

[source,html]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<head>
    ...
    <title>TicketMonster</title>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        $(document).on("pageinit", "#page1", function(event){ 
            $.getJSON("rest/events", function(events) {
                // console.log("returned are " + events);
                var listOfEvents = $("#listOfItems");
                listOfEvents.empty();
                $.each(events, function(index, event) {
                    // console.log(event.name);
                    listOfEvents.append("<li><a href='#'>" + event.name + "</a>");
                });
                listOfEvents.listview("refresh");
            });
        });
    </script>
</head>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:

* On triggering _pageinit_ on the page having id "page1"
* using `$.getJSON("rest/events")` to hit the `EventService.java`
* a commented out `// console.log`, causes problems in IE
* Getting a reference to `listOfItems` which is declared in the HTML using an `id` attribute
* Calling `.empty` on that list - removing the exiting `One, Two, Three` items
* For each event - based on what is returned in step 1 +
* another commented out `// console.log`
* `append` the found event to the UL in the HTML
* `refresh` the `listOfItems` +

[NOTE]
=================================================================================
You may find the `.append("<li>...")` syntax unattractive, embedding HTML inside 
of the JS .append method, this can be corrected using various JS templating 
techniques.
=================================================================================

The result is ready for the average mobile phone. Simply refresh your browser to see the results.

[[jquery_mobile_results_image]]

JBoss Developer Studio and JBoss Tools includes BrowerSim to help you better understand what your mobile application will look like. Look for a "phone" icon in the toolbar, visible in the JBoss Perspective.

[NOTE]
=================================================================================
The BrowserSim tool takes advantage of a locally installed Safari (Mac & Windows)
on your workstation.  It does not package a whole browser by itself.  You will
need to install Safari on Windows to leverage this feature – but that is more
economical than having to purchase a MacBook to quickly look at your mobile-web 
focused application!
=================================================================================

[[mobile_browsersim_image]]
.Mobile BrowserSim
image::gfx/introduction/mobile_browsersim.png[]
The Mobile BrowserSim has a Devices menu, on Mac it is in the top menu bar and on Windows it is available via right-click as a pop-up menu.   This menu allows you to change user-agent and dimensions of the browser, plus change the orientation of the device.

Under the *File* menu, you will find a *View Page Source* option that will open up the mobile-version of the website's source code inside of JBoss Developer Studio.  This is a very useful feature for learning how other developers are creating their mobile web presence.

== Conclusion

This concludes our introduction to building HTML5 Mobile Web applications using Java EE 6 with Forge and JBoss Developer Studio. At this point, you should feel confident enough to tackle any of the additional exercises to learn how the TicketMonster sample application is constructed.

=== Cleaning up the generated code


Before we proceed with the tutorial and implement TicketMonster, we need to clean up some of the archetype-generated code. The Member management code, while useful for illustrating the general setup of a Java EE 6 web application, will not be part of TicketMonster, so we can safely remove some packages, classes, and resources:

* All the Member-related persistence and business code:

** `src/main/java/org/jboss/jdf/example/ticketmonster/controller`
** `src/main/java/org/jboss/jdf/example/ticketmonster/data`
** `src/main/java/org/jboss/jdf/example/ticketmonster/model/Member.java`
** `src/main/java/org/jboss/jdf/example/ticketmonster/rest/MemberResourceRESTService.java`
** `src/main/java/org/jboss/jdf/example/ticketmonster/service/MemberRegistration.java`

* Generated web content

** `src/main/webapp/index.html`
** `src/main/webapp/index.xhtml`
** `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/templates/default.xhtml`

* JSF configuration (we will re-add it via Forge)

** `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/faces-config.xml`

* Prototype mobile application (we will generate a proper mobile interface)

** `src/main/webapp/mobile.html`

Also, we will update the `src/main/resources/import.sql` file and remove the `Member` entity insertion:

[source,sql]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
insert into Member (id, name, email, phone_number) values (0, 'John Smith', 'john.smith@mailinator.com', '2125551212' 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The data file should contain only the Event data import:

[source,sql]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
insert into Event (id, name, description, major, picture, version) values (1, 'Shane''s Sock Puppets', 'This critically acclaimed masterpiece...', true, 'http://dl.dropbox.com/u/65660684/640px-Carnival_Puppets.jpg', 1);
insert into Event (id, name, description, major, picture, version) values (2, 'Rock concert of the decade', 'Get ready to rock...', true, 'http://dl.dropbox.com/u/65660684/640px-Weir%2C_Bob_(2007)_2.jpg', 1);
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
